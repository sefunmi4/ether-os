# 🌌 Ether OS (MVP)

**Ether OS** is a next-generation immersive desktop environment built for experimentation, creativity, and intuitive computing. It combines gesture and voice input, symbolic command mapping, and a modular app system — all within a VR-ready, OS-like shell.

This is the MVP version built using **Electron**, **React**, and **Three.js**, designed to simulate the user experience and test core concepts like Symbol Cast input and a 3D desktop environment.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ Simulated OS desktop (Electron + React + Tailwind)
- 🖼️ 3D environment powered by Three.js
- ✍️ Gesture recognition (Symbol Cast engine)
- 🎙️ Voice command input (Web Speech API)
- 🗂️ Modular "mini-apps" (chat, file viewer, etc.)
- 📦 Simple local mock file system

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Electron** – Native desktop container
- **React + Tailwind CSS** – UI & layout
- **Three.js** – Immersive background and interface
- **TensorFlow.js** – Gesture recognition (simulated)
- **Web Speech API** – Voice input
- **Node.js** – Command routing & filesystem mocking

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/ether-os.git
cd ether-os
npm install
npm run start
```

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

## 🧪 Project Structure
```bash
apps/           → Mini-apps like Chat, File Explorer
renderer/       → Frontend (React + Three.js)
main/           → Electron main process
symbol-cast/    → Gesture & voice recognition logic
qpp-mock/       → Mock logic for Q++ integration
public/         → Static assets
utils/          → Shared functions
```

## 🎯 Goals of the MVP
- Prototype gesture + voice control
- Simulate immersive OS navigation
- Build and test symbolic command workflows
- Gather feedback from early users & creators

---

## 📚 Future Vision

Ether OS will eventually support:
- Native Q++ quantum logic execution
- Symbol Cast spell compiler and scripting language
- Real file systems, networking, and AI agents
- VR-native interface and headset support
- Decentralized user maps and collaboration zones
