# 🧠 EtherOS — Modular Immersive Desktop Environment (MVP)

EtherOS is a next-gen modular desktop environment built for immersive computing, symbolic input, and decentralized session portability.

This repo contains:
- A **NixOS-based desktop environment layer**
- A **browser-accessible web interface**
- A shared runtime system for gestures, state, and command handling

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Create a lightweight, declarative desktop layer on top of NixOS
- Simulate VR/immersive computing with SymbolCast input (gestures & voice)
- Use devices as personal cloud mesh nodes (e.g., headless laptops)
- Offer browser-based access for testing, collaboration, and mobile users

---

## 📁 Structure

```plaintext
nixos/     → Flake + overlays for NixOS DE setup
web/       → Web version of EtherOS UI (React + Tailwind + Three.js)
runtime/   → Shared SymbolCast + state logic
docs/      → Architecture, usage, and planning docs
```


⸻

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 🔹 Run the Web Version
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🔹 Build NixOS Layer

You must have Nix + flakes enabled.
```bash
cd nixos
nix develop
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

Want me to:
- Scaffold the folders + stub files in a zip?
- Create starter `flake.nix` or web `vite.config.ts`?
- Write the architecture doc next?

Let’s build ✨
